# CODENAME: MUILS

What is "MUILS"? 
Muils is a YouTube episodic series where we play a heavily modified version of GTA 5 also known as "Real Life Mod"

## **Mods list for Bestassio's Moving Up In Los Santos**
A lot of mods are combined for Moving Up In Los Santos episodes to exist, this project started way back in April of 2024 and keeps on expanding with each day. Due to the size of the mods which are used in MUILS episodes, and not to spoil what's gonna happen next, this page will be updated with each episode. (Currently on episode 12)


Some of the mods which I use in the videos are no longer available, and while I do have them backed up, I don't want to distribute them, as they were removed for a reason. (Either a DMCA take down, or mod creator no longer wanting to work on them) Althrough you can find them elsewhere (be careful. and I don't recommend or endorse trying to get them elsewhere) a lot of mods which are un-available are really *unstable* and usually might require some maintenence.
For the mods, which are un-available, I will try my best to find a replacement, as soon as one is available.

Moving Up In Los Santos is running on older version of the game (GTA ONLINE Chop Shop Update), mostly because current latest version breaks a lot of older mods which are a necessary

# **Main mods:**

## Prerequisites:

### [ScriptHookV](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/)

 Allows you to load scripts

### [ScriptHookVDotNet](https://github.com/scripthookvdotnet/scripthookvdotnet/releases) / [ScriptHookVDotNet Nightly](https://github.com/scripthookvdotnet/scripthookvdotnet-nightly/releases)

Allows you to load scripts, and reload them, when they break
Nightly is recommended, but in some cases you might need the "normal" DotNet

### iFruitAddon2
 
Allows mods which require a phone to work. Usually included with the mods which require it
 
### [LemonUI](https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/lemonui)
 
Allows mods which require interaction menu's to work
 
### [NativeUI](https://github.com/Guad/NativeUI/releases)
 
Allows mods which require interaction menu's to work. Older version of LemonUI, but some older mods might need it
 

### [Game Config](https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/gta-5-gameconfig-300-cars)
 
Allows your game to not crash after installing 3 mods
 
 
Do note: While this is great as a baseline, it's mostly configured for car mods.
Adding too many weapon mods might still cause your game to crash.
Therefore you need to edit specific values to fix it.
In the case of addon weapons.
You need to add/increase this on line 312 of your game config:
```<Item> <PoolName>CPickupPlacement</PoolName> <PoolSize value="280"/></Item> ```
Just make sure to follow the formatting of how other lines are written

You might need to adjust other values, depending on what you have installed, or planning to install, that's where Pool Manager (listed below) comes in.
 
### [Heap Adjuster](https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/heapadjuster)
 
Allows your game to not crash after installing few mods
 
### [PackfileLimit Adjuster](https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/packfile-limit-adjuster)
 
Allows your game to not crash after installing few mods
 
### [Weapons Limit Adjuster](https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/cweaponinfoblob-limit-adjuster)
 
Allows your game not to crash after installing weapon mods
 
### [Pool Manager](https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/poolmanager-dilapidated)
 
Tells you what crashed your game, and what you need to change in game-config.

If upon installing a mod, your game crashes, and Pool manager doesn't show any error messages, that means, that, that mod is broken beyond fixing, and needs to be updated by it's developer
 

## Essentials:
These are essential. Without these, most of the episodes would be impossible or a huge pain 

### [TrainerV](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/simple-trainer-for-gtav)
 
 Mostly used for loading the character and it's clothing 
 
### [Menyoo PC OG](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/menyoo-pc-sp) / [Menyoo PC 2.0](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/menyoo-2-0)
  
Mostly used for loading weapon loadouts with addon weapons or vehicles if persistance mod fails
 
 
I personally use the outdated OG version, but feel free to use 2.0
 
### [Rampage Trainer](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/rampage-trainer)
 
Has some features which sometimes become useful
 
### [Time Scaler](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/time-scaler)

### [Scene Director](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/scene-director)
 
Allows cinematic shots to happen
 
### [Character Creation Script](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/character-creation-script)
 
Allows to easily swap characters or clothing
 
### Character Swap -  Un-available, mod creator has deleted this mod 
 
Gives any character the all the featues that the main 3 characters have, essentially allowing to use any character with money, and other features that main characters have

There is an alternative, it's called [Playable Online Character](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/playable-online-character) this mod, does essentially what Character swap did, but with a lot of stuff built in, like dealerships, working shops and more!

```
At this very moment, I would not be able to assist you with this mod, as I couldn't get it to work in time (most likely a me issue, as it's most likely colliding with something that I have installed) 
I would say give it a shot, as the mod is more stable then Character swap, and isn't as complicated.
```

## Scripts:

### [Enable All Interiors](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/enable-all-interiors-wip)
  
Collides with a lot of MLO mods. 
And having this mod enabled while having more then 2 mlo's installed will cause map loading issues

## Enviroment

My personal favorite graphics mod is - 

### [VisualV](https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/visualv)
 
There are a lot of great graphics mods, and you might ask why I went with VisualV, and the answer is simple:
It's a nice looking graphics mod, which is vanilla friendly, and most importantly light-weight.
GTA 5 is a old game, which has it's limitations. 
And running 400 car mods and a bunch of script mods + interior/building mods,
While having all online interiors loaded at all times really adds up quickly.
That can either break the game and it's limits or break your performance.
That's why while there are nicer looking graphics mods, this one is the best if you want more gameplay.

### [Forests Of San Andreas](https://www.gta5-mods.com/maps/forests-of-san-andreas-revised)

The famous forests mod, used by a lot of content creators and FiveM RP servers. Also includes some additions to the map, such as the wooden shack in Paleto forest.

### [Realistic Blood](https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/realistic-blood-v)
 
Makes blood go places
 
### [Real Immersive Gun Sounds 1.2](https://www.gta5-mods.com/weapons/real-emersive-gun-sounds)
 
Makes guns sound more.. fun (also includes tire sounds and some other misc sounds)

Note: I use 1.2 version and not 1.3.
1.2 also has a issue with rifles not shooting.
Which can be fixed by downloading a different rifle sound

## Interiors 
Do note: Some or all of these interiors might cause issues, if you are running them with "Enable All Interiors" or Multiplayer Maps enabled. (The closer an interior is to a GTA ONLINE interior, the more likely it is, that it will make map not render anymore. When using these maps, I recommend either temporarily removing EAI mod, or re-enabling and disabling MP Maps in Simple Native Trainer
### [Marabunta Grande House](https://www.gta5-mods.com/maps/mlo-marabunta-grande-fivem-sp)
 
Amazing house mod for starting out located right next to Lester's house.
